# Integrative Transcriptomics and Metabolomics of Arabidopsis thaliana under Environmental Stress
This is course project of Biosystems Data Analysis at VU & UvA, in this project I and my teammate carried out data analysis regarding the metabolomics dataset generated by Caldana et al. (2011), and applied data preprocessing, followed by three distinct data analysis methodsâ€”Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Clustering, and Analysis of Covariance (ASCA).
