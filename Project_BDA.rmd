# BDA project 2023 retake

## Project description

During the project you will use part of the dataset produced by Caldana et al. (2011). You will only use the metabolomics data. 4 experimental conditions are selected: the base condition 21 $^\circ$C and normal light (encoded 21-L), 21 $^\circ$C and bright light (21-HL), 21 $^\circ$C and low light (21-LL), 21 $^\circ$C in the dark (21-D). Of each experiment condition, samples obtained at 40, 120, 360 minutes will be used. For each time point 4 replicate measurements are available. Data have been obtained of 35 metabolites.

You have to apply 3 data analysis methods to the data: Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Clustering and ASCA. You first have to preprocess the data in such a way that the data analysis methods provide useful information.

You goal of the project is that you can show that you understand what the method aims to do with the data, you know how to apply the methods, and you are able to interpret the results. Keep in mind that the assignments are intended to assess whether you reach this goal.

You will hand in your project markdown file and knitted pdf. When writing your code in the code blocks, add comments clarifying what you are doing! You can do this by adding a hash tag ("#") before the comment.


#### Load data
```{r Data importing, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
df_metabolomics = read.csv("Caldana_metabolomics_retake_new.csv")
```


### Assignment 1: Data Preprocessing

Explore the data to decide on optimal data preprocessing. You have to decide whether you want to mean center, scale, or transform the data in any way to improve the interpretation about the differences between the experimental conditions and time points.

Use Valine and Glycine as example metabolites to show how you made your decisions.

Show the calculations you performed, use plots to corroborate your selection and explain in text how and why you made decided on your selected preprocessing approach.

```{r Assignment 1A, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Provide your code here
df_metabolomics = df_metabolomics[,c("Valine","Glycine")]
#df_metabolomics
Val_Gly_mean=apply(df_metabolomics ,2,mean)
Val_Gly_mean
hist(Val_Gly_mean)
Val_Gly_std = apply(df_metabolomics,2,sd)
#Val_Gly_std
Val_Gly_centered = sweep(df_metabolomics,2,Val_Gly_mean, FUN="-")
Val_Gly_scaled = sweep(Val_Gly_centered,2,Val_Gly_std,FUN = "/")
#hist(Val_Gly_scaled)
#Val_Gly_scaled
plot(Val_Gly_scaled$"Valine")
plot(Val_Gly_scaled$"Glycine")
```

#### Write down your explanation here.
To eliminate the effect of unit and scale differences between features in order to treat each dimensional feature equally, the features need to be normalized.First of all, the data should be centered by subtracting the mean of each column from each value in that column. This means that the resulting standardized data will have a mean of 0 for each column.
Then the centered data should also be scaled by dividing each value in a column by the standard deviation of that column. This means that the resulting standardized data will have a standard deviation of 1 for each column.


### Assignment 2: Principal Component Analysis

a\) Perform a principal component analysis of the preprocessed metabolomics data using the svd function. Use only 2 components for the PCA model.

b\) Make a score plot using the first and second principal component.

c\) Show the variance explained by each component in your plot labels.

d\) Add a legend to identify the colour for each Group.

e\) Make a loading plot using the first and second principal component.

f\) Add Variable names to the loadings plot.

```{r AssignmentPCA(a-f), include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Provide your code for questions a-f here

#M_2=scale(M_21L,center = TRUE , scale = TRUE)
df_metabolomics = read.csv("Caldana_metabolomics_retake_new.csv")
#df_metabolomics
df_metabolomics_no_name = df_metabolomics[,-1:-2]
preprocessed_M = scale(df_metabolomics_no_name, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
#preprocessed_M
USV_MR = svd(preprocessed_M)
ssqtotal_MR=sum(preprocessed_M*preprocessed_M)
T_MR = USV_MR$u %*% diag(USV_MR$d) #calculate score
P_MR = USV_MR$v #loadings
npc = 10                           # Calculate 10 PCs
ssq_MR = 0 * (1:npc)  # Initialize variable ssq
for (i in 1:npc){                   # for loop to calculate sum of squares for each component
  Xest_MR  <- T_MR[,i] %*% t(P_MR[,i])
  ssq_MR[i] <- 100*sum(Xest_MR*Xest_MR)/ssqtotal_MR
}
ssqcum_MR = cumsum(ssq_MR)                # calculate cumulative ssq
PCA_MR = data.frame(ssq=ssq_MR,ssqtot=ssqcum_MR)
PCA_MR
plot(T_MR[,1], T_MR[,2],pch=17,col=as.numeric(as.factor(df_metabolomics$Group)),xlab= "T1",ylab ="T2",xlim = c(-12,8),ylim = c(-5,5))
legend(-10,3,c("21-L","21-D","21-LL","21-HL"),col=c(3,1,4,2),pch = 17)

plot(P_MR[,1], P_MR[,2],pch=17,col=as.numeric(as.factor(df_metabolomics$Group)),xlab= "P1",ylab ="P2",xlim = c(-0.5,0.5),ylim = c(-0.5,0.5))
legend(-0.45,0.45,c("21-L","21-D","21-LL","21-HL"),col=c(3,1,4,2),pch = 17)
re_MR = T_MR[,1:2] %*% t(P_MR[,1:2])
E_MR = preprocessed_M - re_MR
E_MR = as.matrix(E_MR)
res_MR = abs(colSums(t(E_MR) %*% E_MR))
MR_SST = sum(preprocessed_M*preprocessed_M)
MR_varexplained = 100*((MR_SST - res_MR)/MR_SST)
plot(MR_varexplained)
which.max(MR_varexplained)
plot(P_MR[,1], P_MR[,2])
text(P_MR[,1], P_MR[,2],1:35)
```

g\) Give your interpretation of the PCA results here. Include both scores, loadings and variation explained to discuss whether there is any difference between the experimental conditions. Use the loadings plot to indicate which metabolites are mainly related to which groups.

#### Write down your explanation here.
T are the scores, P the loadings, ssq shows information on the variance explained. The results show the first PC explained 28.245538 variance, and the second PC explained 17.027774 variance variance. The score plot shows "21-HL"can be best explained by first 2 PCs,followed by"21-L","21-LL","21-D"


h\) Calculate the residuals of the data that are not explained by the 2 component PCA model.

i\) Use bar plots of sum of squared residuals to show which samples and which metabolites were not well modeled by the PCA model.

```{r AssignmentPCA(h-i), include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Provide your code for questions h-i here
E_MR = preprocessed_M - re_MR
E_MR = as.matrix(E_MR)
res_MR = abs(colSums(t(E_MR) %*% E_MR))
#res_MR
which.max(res_MR)
barplot(res_MR,main = "residuals per Individual")

```

#### Discuss the results of the residual analysis here.



### Assignment3: Clustering

### Cluster_samples

a\) Calculate the euclidean distances between the samples in the preprocessed metabolomics data. 
b\) Use the distance matrix to create a hierarchical clustering using average linkage. c\) Plot the dendrogram. 
d\) Discuss how well the samples are clustered within their group.

```{r Assignment Cluster_Samples, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
df_metabolomics = read.csv("Caldana_metabolomics_retake_new.csv")
#df_metabolomics
df_metabolomics_no_name = df_metabolomics[,-1:-2]
preprocessed_M = scale(df_metabolomics_no_name, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
d_MR = dist(preprocessed_M,method = "euclidean" )
hc_MR = hclust(d_MR, method = "average")
clusterCut <- cutree(hc_MR, 3)
table(clusterCut,df_metabolomics$Group)

plot(hc_MR,col="black",col.main="pink",col.lab="pink",col.axis="pink",lwd=1,lty=1,sub="",cex=0.8,axes=FALSE,hang=-2)

axis(side=2,at=seq(0,120,20),col="black",lwd=1,labels=FALSE)

mtext(seq(0,120,20),side=2,at=seq(0,120,20),line=1,col="pink",las=2)

```

#### Put your discussion on clustering samples here
There seem to be 2 major sample groups in the data. Samples 17-19,21-23 which belongs to "21-D"from 120min-360min, separated from the rest. Similarly,samples 41-47 which belongs to "21-HL"from 120min-360min
are clustered.In a word, we can observe that basing on same"light condition"and similar time slot,these samples are well clustered. 

### Cluster_Variables

e\) Calculate the euclidean distances between the variables in the preprocessed metabolomics data. 
f\) Use the distance matrix to create a hierarchical clustering using average linkage. g\) Show the dendrogram. 
h\) Discuss whether the variable clustering result is similar to the loadings of the PCA.

```{r Assignment Cluster_Variables, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
df_metabolomics = read.csv("Caldana_metabolomics_retake_new.csv")
#df_metabolomics
df_metabolomics_no_name = df_metabolomics[,-1:-2]
preprocessed_M = scale(df_metabolomics_no_name, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
preprocessed_M = t(preprocessed_M)
#preprocessed_M
d_MR_V = dist(preprocessed_M,method = "euclidean")
hc_MR_V = hclust(d_MR_V, method = "average")
clusterCut <- cutree(hc_MR_V, 3)


plot(hc_MR_V,col="black",col.main="pink",col.lab="pink",col.axis="pink",lwd=1,lty=1,sub="",cex=0.8,axes=FALSE,hang=-2)

axis(side=2,at=seq(0,120,20),col="black",lwd=1,labels=FALSE)

mtext(seq(0,120,20),side=2,at=seq(0,120,20),line=1,col="pink",las=2)
```

#### Put your interpretation of the clustering of variables here.
We can observe that there are 2 major groups, in the PCA loading plot,for instance, the"maltose,myo-inosit,uracil,sinapic-acid" are grouped is the same with variable clustering result, although in dentrogram they are in different subgroup, but they are in the same major group.

### Assignment 4: ASCA

In this assignment you must use the shiny app for ASCA. To answer the questions below, just make a screenshot of your plot window and include it into the markdown as follows (see the .Rmd):

```{=html}
<!-- Ignore this line

!["Figure caption"]("./path/to/figure.png") 

Ignore this line -->
```
A) Open up the shiny app for ASCA using the DataTool.R script. Load as your dataset the file "Caldana_metabolomics_retake_values.csv" and as your design file "Caldana_metabolomics_retake_design.csv". The "Caldana_metabolomics_retake_values.csv" file contains the same data as the "Caldana_metabolomics_retake_new.csv" file.

B) Go to the univariate plot window. Make a plot of Valine and Glycine in the unpreprocessed way. Then preprocess the variables in the way you decide optimal and make a new plot. Save both plots and add them in this document as shown above.

C)  In the ASCA window of the shiny app, create a model using the factors time, and light, and make the combination Time + Time:Group interaction (Use 2+1:2 as the combination). Make a plot of the combination that shows the differences between the groups and their change over time. Add that plot in this document and provide your interpretation.
D) Knit your rmd file to pdf and upload both files.
